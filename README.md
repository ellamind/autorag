# AutoRAG ðŸš—ðŸ“œðŸ¦œ
Automatic hyperparameter optimization of your retrieval augmented generation pipeline. 

Stop fiddling around manually with embeddings, rerankers, chunk size, top k and so on. Let the machine do the tuning of your RAG pipeline.

This is an early prototype and therefore slow as hell.


## Installation
```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

Set you pararmeters and models in `autorag/config.py` and run the following commands:
```bash
poetry shell
python autorag/main.py
```



Have fun! ðŸ’ƒðŸª©ðŸ•º
